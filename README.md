# Functional Programming Principles in Scala

This repo contains my solutions to the assignments of Coursera's [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1?specialization=scala).

This is probably one of the best MOOCs I've taken. Martin Odersky is not only an expert in the matter (dah!, I know; he created the language!) but he is an outstanding teacher (that I didn't know until I started the course). He explains things so well, thoroughly but with simplicity. Extremely good stuff!

## Assignments

Each directory is a stand-alone SBT project (started from a zip file given in the assignment).
